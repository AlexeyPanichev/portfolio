*One of my favourite quotes lately:*

> “I will die. You will die. We will all die and the universe will carry on without care. All that we have is that shout into the wind - how we live. How we go. And how we stand before we fall.”

― **Pierce Brown, [Golden Son](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/26984955)**
